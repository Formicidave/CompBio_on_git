# Lab 12

## Choose your own adventure!

<hr>

### Introduction

Lab 11 was a combination of items from many weeks of the course, reviewing some of the old and trying some newer items.  For some, the "old" came back easily.  For others, it was a bit of "How did we do that again?"

If you finished Lab 11's problems, then please work on the problems below for this week.  If you did NOT finish Lab 11's problems, then you have a choice: continue to work on Lab 11, or do the problems below.  Like last week, I want you to spend 2 hours working on whatever you choose.  If you finish one, then move to the other.

### Lab 12 new problems: Some more `ggplot()` 

Each of the following problems below will require you to be resourceful in terms of finding functions/commands that do what you want to do, and figuring out how to use them.  

#### Problem 1: A bar plot in `ggplot()`

Write code that makes the following plot from the [Cusack et al. data](https://github.com/flaxmans/CompBio_on_git/blob/master/Datasets/Cusack_et_al/Cusack_et_al_random_versus_trail_camera_trap_data_Ruaha_2013_14.csv)

You probably can't read them, but all the species' names (all 41 of them) are on the x-axis, and the y-axis is the total number of observations of that species in the whole dataset.

#### Problem 2: Rotate the axis tick labels.  

The species names in the plot above are shown as what are called "x-axis tick labels".  Add to your code from above to make the  plot as shown here, with the x-axis tick labels now readable and running 90 degrees to the horizontal:

#### Problem 3: A different orientation, scaling, and sorting

Suppose you decided that you'd like to flip the axes, sort the species from least to most abundant, and also transform the count axis to be logarithmic so that you can see the lower values more easily.  Figure out how to make the following plot:

#### Finishing lab: please push whatever you have done at the end of two hours to GitHub.
