# this is an R-readable Script
# you can run it by pressing the run button, pressing the source button, or with a source command

# in the console, or in a different script, you could "source" this file with a command like:
# source("/path/to/this/dir/ToyRScript.R")

# for example, on Sam's laptop, the following would work:
# source("~/compbio/CompBio_on_git/ExampleScripts/ToyRScript.R")
# note that a source() command can be run from another script... 

x <- 5.3
y <- 10
